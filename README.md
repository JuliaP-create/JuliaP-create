# Hi, I’m Julia 👋

**PhD in Medical Neurosciences** | Translational life‑science researcher → **Data Science & Machine Learning**  
Currently finishing a Data Science/ML bootcamp and building a portfolio of reproducible, well‑documented projects.

---

## What I’m aiming for
I’m combining **deep biomedical/translational domain expertise** with modern **data science + ML** to:
- develop my own data products and research tools, and/or  
- contribute to collaborative projects in life sciences, health, and biotech.

I’m especially interested in problems where **data + experimental context** matter: target discovery, translational decision support, risk/tox signals, and “messy real-world” datasets.

---

## What I bring (from science to ML)
- **10+ years** in preclinical/translational research across metabolic, renal, and neuroscience topics
- Strong track record working in **cross-functional, industry-facing environments**
- Project leadership, stakeholder communication, and a quality/documentation mindset
- Experience working with **omics/transcriptomic insights** in discovery settings  
  *(I’ve used user-friendly tools in industry and collaborated with data science teams; I’m now strengthening hands-on coding for these workflows.)*

---

## What I’m building right now
- End-to-end ML projects: EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → interpretation
- Clean notebooks and repos that are easy to run (requirements, clear README, reproducible steps)
- Practical SQL + analytics work (data extraction, joins, aggregations, reporting-ready outputs)

---

## Tech stack (current + growing)
**Core:** Python, SQL, Git/GitHub, Jupyter  
**Data:** pandas, numpy  
**ML:** scikit-learn (classification/regression, model selection, metrics)  
**Viz:** matplotlib / seaborn (plus storytelling with clear charts)  
**Growing next:** packaging, testing, CI (GitHub Actions), lightweight apps (Streamlit)

## How I work
- I like simple baselines, clear evaluation, and honest limitations.
- I document assumptions and decisions (what I tried, what worked, what didn’t).
- I care about making projects readable for others: structure, naming, and “how to run”.
